Ledgre 2.6.1 binaries for windows systems

As it is really time consuming to compile ledger under windows (you need to download cygwin, etc.), I decided to make ledger windows binaries available at this site.

I use ledger for my personal needs. Ledger is a great tool, I like it very much. Thanks to John Wiegley!
