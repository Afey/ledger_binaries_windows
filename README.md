Ledger 2.6.1 binaries for windows systems

As it is really time consuming to compile ledger under windows (you need to download cygwin, etc.), 
I decided to make ledger windows binaries available here.
Ledger binaries for windows systems in this repository are compiled by me.

I use ledger for my personal needs. Ledger is awesome, I like it very much. 
Thanks to John Wiegley!

P.S. Please note that it is the old version of ledger.
